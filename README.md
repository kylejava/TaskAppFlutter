# Task List App

A simple to-do list application made from the mobile framework Flutter.
Developed this app in order to get more comfortable using the framework
and to learn more about app development.

Building this app helped me learn the basics of Flutter and how to
create and edit widgets, as well as make them interact with other widgets in the app.

## Tools Used
 - Flutter
 - Android studio
